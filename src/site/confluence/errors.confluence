h1. Error Handling

h2. Background
ZooKeeper is a very low level system that requires users to do a lot of housekeeping. See:

* [[http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ZooKeeper/FAQ]]

The Curator [[Framework|curator-framework/index.html]] is designed to hide as much of the details/tedium of this housekeeping as is possible.

h2. Connection Guarantees
The Curator [[Framework|curator-framework/index.html]] constantly monitors the connection to the ZooKeeper ensemble. Further every operation is wrapped
in a retry mechanism. Thus, the following guarantees can be made:

* Every Curator operation properly waits until the ZooKeeper connection is established
* Every Curator [[Framework|curator-framework/index.html]] operation (create, getData, etc.) is guaranteed to manage connection loss and/or session expiration per the currently set retry policy
* If the connection is temporarily lost, Curator will attempt to retry the operation until it succeeds per the currently set retry policy
* All Curator recipes attempt to deal with connection issues in an appropriate way

h2. Notifications
Curator exposes several listenable interfaces for clients to monitor the state of the ZooKeeper connection.

{{ConnectionStateListener}} is called when there are connection disruptions. Clients can monitor these changes and take
appropriate action. These are the possible state changes:

|CONNECTED|Sent for the first successful connection to the server. NOTE: You will only get one of these messages for any CuratorFramework instance.|
|SUSPENDED|There has been a loss of connection. Leaders, locks, etc. should suspend until the connection is re\-established. If the connection times\-out you will receive a LOST notice.|
|RECONNECTED|A suspended or lost connection has been re\-established.|
|LOST|The connection is confirmed to be lost. Close any locks, leaders, etc. and attempt to re\-create them. NOTE: it is possible to get a RECONNECTED state after this but you should still consider any locks, etc. as dirty/unstable.|
|READ_ONLY|The connection has gone into read\-only mode. This can only happen if you pass true for CuratorFrameworkFactory.Builder.canBeReadOnly(). See the ZooKeeper doc regarding read only connections: [[http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ZooKeeper/GSoCReadOnlyMode]]. The connection will remain in read only mode until another state change is sent.|

{{UnhandledErrorListener}} is called when a background task, etc. catches an exception. In general, Curator users shouldn't care
about these as they are logged. However, you can listen for them if you choose.

h2. Recipes
In general, the recipes attempt to deal with errors and connection issues. See the doc for each recipe for details on how it deals with errors.
